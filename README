# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

This repository features the implementation of a **tree-based Machine Learning algorithm**, built from scratch without using any ML frameworks or libraries.  
The model uses a **tree-like structure** to make predictions, consisting of:
- **Root node**: the starting point of the decision process.  
- **Branches**: representing conditions or decisions.  
- **Leaf nodes**: representing the final outcomes.  

## Features
- Implemented in **pure Python** (no external ML libraries).  
- Supports **training and prediction** using decision rules.  
- Modular design for easy extension or modification.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
(No external dependencies required)

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the main script:
