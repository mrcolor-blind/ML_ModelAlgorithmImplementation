# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

This repository features the implementation of a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model**, built entirely from scratch without using any ML frameworks or libraries.  
The algorithm makes predictions by:
- **Finding the k closest data points** (neighbors) to a given input based on a distance metric.  
- **Averaging the target values** of those neighbors to produce the final prediction.  

## Features
- Implemented in **pure Python** (no external ML libraries).  
- Supports **training (storing data)** and **prediction (using neighbors)**.  
- Configurable **k value** (number of neighbors).  
- Modular design for easy extension or modification (e.g., adding different distance metrics like Euclidean, Manhattan).  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
(No external dependencies required)

## Usage
